## Project 3 Submission: Rec and Parks
### Description:

"It's like Yelp, but for Parks!" - Probably a New Yorker.

For our final project and in order to leverage our learnings over the past six months, we created an app that allows users to create a profile, search NYC parks, and view/leave reviews. We look forward to developing the map capabilities further to ensure more accurate location estimates and to include travel time and park details.
